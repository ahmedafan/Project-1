I utilized SQL to explore the data for this project by using the COVID-19 data from Our World in Data. Here are some highlights of my findings:

Total Vaccinations Administered: A comprehensive count of vaccinations given globally, showing the extent of immunization efforts.
Percentage of the Population Impacted: Analysis of how many people have been affected by COVID-19 in various countries, reflecting the virus's reach.
Countries with the Greatest Infection Rate: Identification of nations with the highest rates of COVID-19 infections.
Total Cases Compared to Total Fatalities: A comparison of the number of confirmed cases versus the number of deaths, providing insight into the virus's lethality.
Countries with the Highest Death Toll: Ranking of countries based on the total number of COVID-19-related deaths.
Global Proportion of People with COVID-19: The overall percentage of the global population that has contracted the virus.
These insights offer a detailed look at the pandemic's impact worldwide.
